It all began here! My very first coding project from 2018.

## Description
This project, completed during the 2018-2019 school year, involves creating a game inspired by the longest word challenge from the French TV show "Des chiffres et des lettres" on France 3. The game involves selecting ten random letters, with the user then trying to form the longest possible word containing some or all of those letters. The word must exist in the French language.

The program reads the word entered by the user, checks that the word is composed of letters from the random selection, and displays the correspondence between the letters in the word and the selected letters. It then checks if the word is present in the dictionary. If both conditions are met, the program displays the length of the word.

The letters do not have accents, cedillas, or umlauts. They are written in capital letters.
